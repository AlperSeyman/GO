* Sequential (No Goroutines): One chef cooks the burger, then waits for it to finish. Then they cook the fries.
                              Then they pour the drink. The line of customers moves very slowly.


* Goroutines: One chef starts the burger, then immediately starts the fries,
              then immediately pours the drink. Everything is happening at once.


* Multiplexing: A method that sends many different signals or messages through one single path at the same time.
                Instead of building a separate wire for every task, it shares one connection to make the system more efficient and cheaper.
                Think of it like a single highway with many lanes that allows different cars to reach their destinations simultaneously.


* Channel: A safe "communication pipe" that allows different parts of a program (Goroutines) to share information with each other.
           It works by letting one part of the program send data and another part receive it, which keeps the data organized.
           By using channels, you ensure that your tasks can talk to each other safely without causing mistakes or crashes.
