* Sequential (No Goroutines): One chef cooks the burger, then waits for it to finish. Then they cook the fries.
                            Then they pour the drink. The line of customers moves very slowly.


* Goroutines: One chef starts the burger, then immediately starts the fries,
            then immediately pours the drink. Everything is happening at once.


* Multiplexing: A method that sends many different signals or messages through one single path at the same time.
                Instead of building a separate wire for every task, it shares one connection to make the system more efficient and cheaper.
                Think of it like a single highway with many lanes that allows different cars to reach their destinations simultaneously.
