* Sequential (No Goroutines): One chef cooks the burger, then waits for it to finish. Then they cook the fries.
                            Then they pour the drink. The line of customers moves very slowly.


* Goroutines: One chef starts the burger, then immediately starts the fries,
            then immediately pours the drink. Everything is happening at once.
